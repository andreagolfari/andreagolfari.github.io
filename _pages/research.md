- [CoCo-Induced Collapse and Bank Equity Returns](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4496833), with Linda Allen and Joonsung Won.

Abstract: Using equity returns on all banks (across 28 countries) that ever issued contingent convertible capital securities (CoCos), we identify a “CoCo-induced collapse option,” that 
apparently was exercised during the March 2023 failure of Credit Suisse. Reflecting this option’s value, abnormal announcement returns for non-dilutive CoCos with positive 
wealth transfers to shareholders upon CoCo trigger are positive if banks have large amounts of CoCos. Systemic risk-reducing CoCos without this option have significantly 
negative announcement returns. Banks issuing dilutive CoCos overperform (exceeding 20 basis points monthly) during periods of high aggregate uncertainty. Dilutive CoCos 
are more prevalent in common and French-civil law countries.

- [Do CoCos Serve the Goals of Macroprudential Supervisors or Bank Managers?](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intfin.2023.10176), with Linda Allen. Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions & Money, Volume 84, April 2023, 101761.

Abstract: Using a hand-collected, comprehensive sample of contingent capital bonds (CoCos) issued by banks over the 2009-2019 period, we identify shifts in CoCo design features
that nullify their putative salutary macroprudential benefits. Increasingly, CoCos are issued without punitive wealth transfers from shareholders to bondholders, thereby 
removing incentives for bank managers to take preemptive, risk-reducing action in order to prevent the CoCo from triggering. That is, CoCos are overwhelmingly issued with conversion ratios of zero (principal writedowns) that do not mitigate bank risk taking. 

Further, CoCo issuance can be used to circumvent supervisory discretion over bonus and dividend payouts. That is, CoCos issued as Additional Tier 1 capital relax regulatory constraints, particularly for banks close to the Maximum Distributable Amount (MDA) threshold. Bank managers are aware of these loopholes and exploit them to
the detriment of financial market stability and macroprudential objectives.
