I am a 2024 Job Market Candidate, and Visiting Assistant Professor at <a href="https://www.coloradocollege.edu/basics/contact/directory/people/golfari_andrea.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colorado College</a> after completing my PhD in Finance at <a href="https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Baruch College, Zicklin School of Business</a>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I conduct research in the areas of Banking and Financial Intermediation, Corporate Finance, Capital Regulation, Macroprudential Policy and Systemic Risk.

My current work is focused on the role of Contingent Convertible Capital Instruments (CoCos) in the regulatory capital stack of global financial institutions, their effects on managerial incentives, their implications on bank equity returns, their value as macroprudential policy tool.

Before earning my PhD from Baruch College, I received a Masters in International Affairs (International Finance and Economic Policy concentration) and Bachelor of Arts in Economics from Columbia University, and a Laurea in Communication Sciences from the University of Bologna.
