I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at [Boston College](https://bc.edu/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/economics.html). My research interests lie in the fields of Empirical Industrial Organization, Health Economics and Quantitative Marketing. My job market paper investigates how gender-based pricing bans impact health insurance markets characterized by the use of guaranteed renewable contracts.

Before joining Boston College, I completed my Masters in Economics from Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile.

I am on the job market and I will be available for interviews at the ASSA 2023.
