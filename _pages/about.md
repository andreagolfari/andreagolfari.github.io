I am a Job Market Candidate in Finance at <a href="[https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/academic-programs/doctoral/)](https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/academic-programs/doctoral/)">Baruch College</a>. 
  
  My research interests lie in the fields of Empirical Industrial Organization, Health Economics and Quantitative Marketing. My job market paper investigates how gender-based pricing bans impact health insurance markets characterized by the use of guaranteed renewable contracts.

Before joining Boston College, I completed my Masters in Economics from Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile.
