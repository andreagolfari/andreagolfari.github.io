I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at [Boston College](https://bc.edu/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/economics.html). My research interests lie in the fields of Empirical Industrial Organization, Health Economics and Quantitative Marketing. My job market paper studies the effect of unintendedly induced adverse selection on health insurance markets with Guaranteed Renewable contracts. 

Before joining Boston College, I completed my Masters in Economics from Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile.
